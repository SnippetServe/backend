# SnippetServe (backend) &middot; [![Github Actions](https://github.com/SnippetServe/backend/workflows/Deploy%20To%20Heroku/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SnippetServe/backend/actions) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/SnippetServe/backend/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is the backend repository of SnippetServe, a place for developers to share and re-use code snippets with ease

Made with:
üî• [NodeJs]()
üî• [ReactJs]()

## Installing / Getting started

Note: You can find the frontend in the [frontend repo](https://github.com/SnippetServe/frontend.git)

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/SnippetServe/backend`
2. Install all the packages required: `yarn install`
3. Create a new file under root of this project called `.env`. Add properties as mentioned in `.env.example`. You need a Postgres DB running.
4. Now run `yarn devRun`, this will start nodemon as well, so even if you change any code, it will automatically compile.
5. For production use `yarn start`

## Developing

### Backend Built With

- Typescript
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- TypeORM
- Postgresql

### Prerequisites

- Clone or fork this repo.
- Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
- Create a .env file if it doesn't exist or change the existing one with your postgres db url.
- Pick up an issue or a card from the trello board (need to be added to access it). Create a new branch named `trello-id/feature`. For example `235x53/oauth-implementation`
- After you have made changes, make sure that `yarn lint` and `yarn build` doesn't throw any errors and `yarn devRun` works as expected.
- If `yarn lint` throws any errors you can autofix most of these errors by running `yarn lintFix`. If errors persist even after this, then you have to manually fix these. You can use vscode to do so. Just hover over the error and vscode will show you a suggestion(`ctrl + .` also works on windows).
- Now commit your changes and push to the above branch that you created and then raise a PR to master.
- You will need at least 2 approvals before your changes get merged into master.

üêõ Found a issue or bug? Feel free to open a [issue]() üòÉ

üî• Have a feature in mind? Feel free to submit a [pull request]() üòá

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. Coming soon.

## Configuration

All you need is the above-mentioned `.env` file. Create one and copy in the content from `.env.example`. Change the `DATABASE_URL` with your own database.
For development environment the `JWT_SECRET` can be the same as the example, for production change with an appropriate one.

## Tests

Coming soon?

## Api Reference

### Authentication
You can get your API key by making a request to the signin route and then send the API Token as a Bearer token as indicated below:
`Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>` Pass this in the header

### Snippets
1. `GET` `/api/snippets` : Get one specific snippet with a `uuid`

    The request should look like this:    
    ```
    {
        "uuid": "c2d6c07d-cef1-4bfd-ba44-6a732ae6cea5"
    }
    ```

    The expected response should look like this:
    ```
    {
        "snippet": {
            "uuid": "efa3de67-3459-48df-92d3-8a8c17bd91c8",
            "createdAt": "2020-09-06T08:34:12.171Z",
            "updatedAt": "2020-09-06T08:55:27.046Z",
            "description": "Sample",
            "private": false,
            "tags": "python",
            "downvotes": 0,
            "upvotes": 0,
            "lang": "Python",
            "code": "print(\"Hi\")",
            "userUUID": "679031cd-f3a7-48b1-a765-528f37cf2018"
        }
    }
    ```
2. `POST` `/api/snippets` : Create a new snippet 
   
    The request should look like this:    

    ```
    {
        "description": "Sample",
        "isPrivate": "False",
        "tags": "",
        "lang": "Python",
        "code": "print(\"Hi\")"
    }
    ```
    The snippet would be created under the current user

    The expected response should look like this:
    ```
    {
        "snippet": {
            "description": "Sample",
            "private": "False",
            "tags": "",

            "userUUID": "679031cd-f3a7-48b1-a765-528f37cf2018",
            "uuid": "c2d6c07d-cef1-4bfd-ba44-6a732ae6cea5",
            "createdAt": "2020-09-06T09:14:27.245Z",
            "updatedAt": "2020-09-06T09:14:27.245Z"
        }
    }
    ```

    The request should contain all the fields of the snippet (ideally get the snippet first and then update) and should look something like this:
    ```
    {
        "description": "Sample",
        "isPrivate": "False",
        "tags": "",

    }
    ```

            "downvotes": 0,
            "upvotes": 0,
            "lang": "Python",
            "code": "print(\"Hi! This is a update!\")",
            "userUUID": "679031cd-f3a7-48b1-a765-528f37cf2018",
            "uuid": "c2d6c07d-cef1-4bfd-ba44-6a732ae6cea5",
